    <h1>JavaScript History</h1>

    <h5>JavaScript / ECMAScript</h5>
    <p class="p1">JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995.

        It was developed for Netscape 2, and became the ECMA-262 standard in 1997.

        After Netscape handed JavaScript over to ECMA, the Mozilla foundation continued to develop JavaScript for the
        Firefox browser. Mozilla's latest version was 1.8.5. (Identical to ES5).

        Internet Explorer (IE4) was the first browser to support ECMA-262 Edition 1 (ES1).</p>

    <h3 class="myh1">The ECMA Technical Committee 39 </h3><br>
    In 1996, Netscape and Brendan Eich took JavaScript to <br>the ECMA international standards organization, and a
    technical committee (TC39) was created to develop the language.

    ECMA-262 Edition 1 was released in June 1997. <br>



    <h3 class="myh2">From ES4 to ES6</h3>
    When the TC39 committee got together in Oslo in 2008, to agree on ECMAScript 4, <br>they were divided into 2 very
    different camps:

    <h3 class="myh3">The ECMAScript 3.1 Camp: </h3><br>
    Microsoft and Yahoo who wanted an incremental upgrade from ES3.

    <h3>The ECMAScript 4 Camp:</h3>
    Adobe, Mozilla, Opera, and Google who wanted a massive ES4 upgrade. <br>

    August 13 2008, Brendan Eich wrote an email: <br>

    It's no secret that the JavaScript standards body, Ecma's Technical Committee 39, <br>has been split for over a
    year, with some members favoring ES4, a major fourth edition to ECMA-262, and others advocating ES3.1 based on the
    existing ECMA-262 Edition 3 (ES3) specification. Now, I'm happy to report, the split is over.

    <h3 class="myh4">The solution was to work together:</h3>
    ECMAScript 4 was renamed to ES5 <br>
    ES5 should be an incremental upgrade of ECMAScript 3. <br>
    Features of ECMAScript 4 should be picked up in later versions. <br>
    TC39 should develop a new major release, bigger in scope than ES5. <br>
    The planned new release (ES6) was codenamed "Harmony" (Because of the split it created?). <br>

    ES5 was a huge success. It was released in 2009, and all major browsers (including Internet Explorer) were fully
    compliant by July 2013: <br>

    Chrome 23 IE10 / Edge Firefox 21 Safari 6 Opera 15 <br>
    Nov 2012 Sep 2012 May 2013 Jul 2012 Jul 2013 <br>
    ES6 was also a huge success. It was released in 2015, and all major browsers were fully compliant by March 2017:
    <br>

    Chrome 51 Edge 14 Firefox 52 Safari 10 Opera 38 <br>
    May 2016 Aug 2016 Mar 2017 Sep 2016 Jun 2016 <br>
